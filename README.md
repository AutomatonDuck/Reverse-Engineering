# Reverse-Engineering

This a collection of personal notes and musings about the concept of reverse engineering.<br> 
I eventually want to add projects or links to created repositories with tools and projects, <br>
but for now its pretty much a mix between a summary of the book: [_Hacking: The Art of Exploitation_](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hacking+the+art+of+exploitation&qid=1643843368&sprefix=Hacking+the+a%2Caps%2C94&sr=8-1) <br>
along with my own personal knowledge on the topics discussed in the book.
I am looking to develop a community and work with other interested in reverse engineering.<br>
So feel free to fork this or reach out to colaberate
